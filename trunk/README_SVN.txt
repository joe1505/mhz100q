**************** MHZ100Q ***************************

MHZ100Q is a collection of components for high-speed
data acquistion, including
- A 100MHz 8-bit quad A/D PCB design.
- VHDL code to capture data from the PCB.
- Firmware for a Cypress CY7C68013A USB interface.
- Drivers to access the USB interface from Octave
  and -eventually- from Matlab.

Currently, it is in a preliminary state: Data can be
captured and displayed, but many features are not
working.

The project is hosted on Sourceforge. Some useful
links:

http://mhz100q.sourceforge.net/             - Homepage.
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mhz100q - Project page.

Code is maintained in a Subversion repository. I don't
plan to release packages until it's in a more polished
state.

To download, you can either follow links from the homepage,
go directly to the repostory to browse:
